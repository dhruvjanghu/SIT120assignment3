    <h1>Eureka Skydeck </h1>
    <h2> History </h2>


    <p>
      
        Eureka Tower is named after the Eureka Stockade, 
        a rebellion during the Victorian gold rush in 1854. 
        This has been incorporated into the design, with the building's gold 
        crown representing the gold rush and a red stripe representing the 
        blood spilt during the revolt. On a side of the Eureka Tower, on 
        Melbourne's Southbank, you'll find a colony of giant golden bees. 
        It's a giant sculpture, designed by Richard Stringer, and made from 
        anodized aluminium. These creatures are a gleaming metaphor for a hive 
        of frenetic activity and harmonious high-density city living. The World
        Class Land development project consists of a 316.7-metre (1,039 ft) tall 
        apartment building with 1,105 apartments over 100 floors.
