    <h2> History </h2>


    <p>
        The Great Ocean Road is an Australian National Heritage
         listed 240-kilometre stretch of road along the south-eastern
          coast of Australia between the Victorian cities of Torquay 
          and Allansford. The Great Ocean Road is permanent memorial 
          to those who died while fighting in World War I carved in rock. 
          Built by returned servicemen, it winds around the rugged southern 
          coast and was a huge engineering feat ending decades of isolation 
          for Lorne and other coastal communities.
